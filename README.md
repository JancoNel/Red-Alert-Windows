# Red-Alert-Windows
- So lets keep this brief
- Red Alert is the name of lockdown script I made for myself, but yall can use it as well
- The idea is that if your computer is hacked your EDR solution just runs the compiled .exe file and then it pings you in discord using discord webhook
- The setup is rather simple , just compile with pyinstaller, set a WEBHOOK variable with the url to your discord webhook
